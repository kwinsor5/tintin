* Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install [[https://tintin.mudhalla.net/][TinTin++]]

* Quick Start

** Unix

1. Run =./run.sh=
2. This will automatically connect to [[https://rotsmud.org][rots]]
3. After connecting and logging in to a character run the
   command =setup default=
   1. This will set everything up in the game to successfully work with
      the client.
** Windows

As of Windows 10 it is possible to run TinTin++ using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
The biggest advantage of WSL, particularly WSL 2, is performance. Installation
instructions are as following:

1. Use the search assistant to open the 'For Developers' setting and enable 'Developer Mode'.
2. Use the search assistant to open the 'Turn Windows features on or off' setting and turn on
  'Windows Subsystem for Linux'
3. Use the search assistant to open the 'bash' application which should tell you to visit the
  WSL Store where you can download your favorite Linux distribution, with Ubuntu being the
  most convenient one.
4. Once Ubuntu is up and running use 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get install tintin++'
  to install TinTin++.
5. Then clone or download this repository using WSL and following the Unix Quick Start.

* Profiles

After logging into your character their special profile will try to be loaded
from =/profiles/{CharacterName}.tt=. Please note that capitalization is important
as the characters is loaded from the info command.

** Character Files

The following variables and aliases should be set on each character profile.

#+begin_src

#nop This needs to be set for the gg aliase to work
#var food {};

#nop This is special for character to wear their armor set
#alias {wa} {
    wear all.metal;
};

#nop This is special for each character to remove their armor set
#alias {ra} {
    rm all.chain;
};

#nop This sets your primary weapon
primary glimmering;

#nop This sets your secondary weapon
secondary dragon;

#nop This sets your hitter weapon and/or bow
hitter longbow;

#+end_src

This isn't required for the client to work correctly, but I like to add
practices to each character profile for fast specialization switching
for example:

#+begin_src

#alias {respec fire} {
    tell angel pracreset;
    spec fire;
    prac blaze;
    setup_class_pracs;
};

#alias {respec cold} {
    tell angel pracreset;
    spec cold;
    setup_class_pracs;
};

#alias {respec battle} {
    tell angel pracreset;
    spec battle magic;
    setup_class_pracs;
};

#alias {setup_class_pracs} {
    setup_default_mage_prac;
    setup_default_warrior_prac;
    setup_default_ranger_prac;
    setup_default_mystic_prac;
};

#+end_src

* Screen

** Main Window

The main window for the game.

** Map Window

The map window will display your current known location on the map. It
will also follow you around Arda, providing the area is known and mapped.

** Communications Window

The communication window should capture all the communication channels
in the game. It will not suppress them in the main window so you can still
see them there as well.

** Prompt Window

The prompt window will capture the players health, stamina, and moves when
=advancedview= is enabled. It will also display the current room name the
player is in and the XP per minute gauge.

When the PK targeting systems is enabled it will show the current target
keyword and whether auto engage and auto track is enabled.

* Window Mode

The screen is setup in three different modes

** Default Mode

The default  mode has the main, map, prompt and communications window.

#+begin_src

+-----------------------+
|  Main       |  Map    |
|             |         |
|             |         |
|             |         |
|             |---------|
|             |  Comms  |
|             |         |
|             |         |
|-------------|         |
|  Prompt     |         |
+-----------------------+

#+end_src

** Mapping Mode

The mapping mode has the map and main window displayed. This mode is
great if you want a big map view of the area.

#+begin_src

+-----------------------+
|       Map             |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|                       |
|-----------------------|
|       Main            |
|                       |
|                       |
+-----------------------+

#+end_src

To toggle this mode on and off use the alias =mapping=

** Mobile Mode

The mobile mode has the map and main window displayed. The map
is much smaller and should only be used as a quick reference
for where the player is at.

#+begin_src

+----------+
|  Map     |
|          |
|          |
|----------|
|  Main    |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
|          |
+----------+

#+end_src

* General
** Buffing

To enable buffering mode press =||= which will toggle rescuing members of
your group. To assign followers just group them and type =group= to display
them and an action will fire to capture everybody in your current group.

#+begin_src
> ||

Buffer Mode Enabled.

> ||

Buffer Mode Disabled.
#+end_src

** Mapping

For mapping to work =advancedview= must be enabled. The mapping system uses
the room name, room id, and terrain to build the map. When leaving the room
it will check for duplicate entries. If there are you will be prompted.

*** Enabling Mapping

To enable mapping just use the command =automapping= to toggle mapping on
and off.

*** Autosaving

A ticker is loaded up at start to save the map any time a change is made every
60 seconds.

*** Doors

When you are mapping and need to create a door use the following commands to
do so.

**** GMD

The alias =gmd= is used to create a new room in the direction given and assign
a non-locked door.

#+begin_src
Example:

> gmd e heavydoor

#+end_src

**** MD

The alias =md= is used to mark an exit as a door with the given name and mark
it as avoid on the map, avoid will keep the =#map run= and =#path run= command
from using that direction. Use this command if you want to mark a door that
can't be entered in while mounted.

#+begin_src
Example:

> md e heavydoor

#+end_src

**** MDD

The alias =mdd= is used to mark an exit as a door with the given name and not
mark it as avoid on the map. Use this command if you want to mark an exit that
is hidden but can still ride through it.

#+begin_src
Example:

> mdd e bush

#+end_src

**** DMG

The alias =dmg= is used to create a new room in the direction given and assign
a locked gate to the door.

#+begin_src
Example:

> dmg e heavygate

#+end_src

**** MG

The alias =mg= is used to mark an exit as a gate with the given name and mark
it as avoid on the map.

#+begin_src
Example:

> mg e heavygate

#+end_src

**** MLD

The alias =mld= is used to mark an exit as a locked door with the given name and
mark the exit as avoid on the map.

#+begin_src
Example:

> mld e heavydoor

#+end_src

**** MPD

The alias =mpd= is used to mark an exit as a pick-able door with the given name
and mark the exit as avoid on the map.

#+begin_src
Example:

> mpd e heavydoor

#+end_src

*** Legend

The map for TinTin is configured to display the terrain around the room and special
identifiers in the room such as smobs, keys and etc...

**** Terrain

The terrain around the room is set by using the command =#map set roomterrian= to
get a full list of terrains use the command =#map terrain=

| Terrain      | Symbol | Colour       |
|--------------+--------+--------------|
| Crack        | Cc     | <caa>        |
| Dense Forest | *      | <abb>        |
| Field        | "'     | <aff>        |
| Floor        | Oo     | <aaa>        |
| Forest       | *      | <aeb>        |
| Hills        | h      | <ebd>        |
| Mountains    | v^     | <eff>v<aef>^ |

| Water        | ~      | <adf>        |
| Water Noswim | ~      | <aaf>        |

**** Room Symbols

** PK'ing

The PVP, player versus player, system will set the target of you choosing
and bypass the targeting system. To use auto track and engage you should
add the following to your characters profile:

#+begin_src

#var {PK[auto][track]} {1};
#var {PK[auto][engage]} {1};

#+end_src

| Alias | Action                         |
|-------+--------------------------------|
| tb    | Hobbit                         |
| td    | Dwarf                          |
| th    | Human                          |
| te    | Elf                            |
| tl    | Uruk-Lhuth                     |
| tbb   | Beorning                       |
| tka   | Disables auto track and engage |
| taa   | Enable auto track and engage   |
| tk    | Kills PK'ing targeting         |

** Setup Aliases

There are a couple setup aliases that need to be run for the targeting system
and mapping system to work correctly. These are all just personal aliases that
I use and can be reconfigured, however you'll need to update =targetsystem.tt=.

*** setup default

This alias sets all the colours and settings needed by this repository to work
correctly.

*** setup alias

This sets all the character aliases in-game for tactics, track, group, detail
damage and drinking.

*** setup mage

This sets all the character aliases in-game for mage spells, this is required
for the targeting system.

*** setup hai mage

Same as =setup mage= but for Uruk-Hai mages.

*** setup lhuth

Same as =setup mage= but for Uruk-Lhuths

*** setup mystic

This sets all the character aliases in-game for mystic powers, this is required
for the targeting system.

*** setup ranger

This sets a very basic amount of in-games aliases for rangers.

** Targeting System

The targeting system gets a full list of mobs in the room and
tries to guess their common name by their description. Then assigns
them to a static aliases for quick actions.

It does this by capturing the third word in the mobs look
description, unless that word is in the badwords list in which it
uses the second word. After getting the keyword for the mob it then
checks to see if that mob keyword is already in the targeting list.
If so it increments the number assignment to the mob. For example
if you are in a room with 4 war orcs. It will get the word *built*
because this is the third word in the look description and assign
values 1 through 4 for them. So if you use the alias =l1= or =lt= it will
exam the first *1.built* mob in the room. Furthermore if you use
the alias =l4= it will exam the fourth *4.built* mob in the room.

#+begin_src

Noisy Tunnel (#14486) [ Floor ]    Exits are: E S W
(1) A heavily built and tattooed war orc sneers at you.
(2) A heavily built and tattooed war orc sneers at you.
(3) A heavily built and tattooed war orc sneers at you.
(4) A heavily built and tattooed war orc sneers at you.

> lt

exam 1.built

> l2

exam 2.built

#+end_src

For the first target in each room the post-fix of =t= is added to the
action. For example, =lt= will exam the first target in the room, =kt=
will attack the first target in the room, =pt= will send the p command
to the first target in the room, and etc...

Please refer to the =tin/targetsystem.tt= file for the full list of
aliases assigned to this.


** Racial

Currently there are two racial configurations setup for RotS, Olog-Hai and
Common Orc. To use the Common Orc class type =OrcOn= this will read the
Orc.tt file to load all the triggers and aliases needed for the Orc
race.

Olog-Hai configuration is always active and can be found in Olog.tt
which set timers and delays for commands.

Currently, there skills are setup for perfectly time combos, please see list
below:

- cos - cleave stomp smash swing
- ocs - stomp cleave smash swing
- soc - smash stomp cleave swing

There are also timers setup to give you a five second warning before the skill
becomes available.
