* Bot System Design Notes

This is design notes for a bot system for the MUD Return of the Shadow.

** Events

*** Reset Room Data

+ Entering a room on the map should reset the bot system to a default state.

*** Mob Name

+ The targetting system should pass in the names of the mobs and check to see if they are a valid bot target.

+ If a valid target is found attack the target

  + This should pause the bot system.

*** Getting Attacked

+ Getting attacked should pause the bot system.

+ Multiple attacks should change tactics

  + Create a variable event to change tactics based on the number of mob currently engaged with.

*** Attacking

+ Attacking a mob should pause the bot system

*** Mob Death

+ After a mob dies it should resume the bot system, only if you aren't currently engaged with multiple targets.

  + After resuming we should re-examine the room for more mobs

    + If playerfound then move forward.

*** Nothing

+ We didn't find anything move forward.
